<h2 id="Motto"><u>Our Motto</u></h2>
<br>
<p><b>Our vision is to make New Zealand an ideal country to live in, with the cleanest and best environment, education system, and a nation with a good economy that will be regarded as heaven on earth.</b> </p>

<h2 id="Funds"><u>How will we get funded</u></h2>
<br>
<p><b>My party will be funded by establishing a charity through which individual donors, who are ordinary citizens, can donate to support our party, as well as corporate donors, who are large industrialists who support our policies. In addition, we will charge membership fees for candidates who are willing to join our party.</b> </p>

<h3>Education</h3><br>


<h4><b><u>Better education through computer and internet:</u></b></h4>
<br>
<p>We can improve education by investing more money in the best educational technology for all schools. Many schools, particularly those in rural areas, do not have very good computers and internet access for their students. Through this act, we are attempting to provide equal and better education beginning immediately, because computers are our future and will improve our nation as soon as we adapt to them. </p>   
<br><br>
<h4><b><u>Raising the standards of teachers:</u></b></h4>
<br>
<p>We intend to raise teacher standards in the educational system. We want to increase the pay of teachers who work hard to ensure our future success. Because of the low pay in the field, many people do not pursue careers in education. We intend to raise teacher pay to compete with other corporate sectors. As a result, we are attempting to recruit more students to become teachers in the future in order to fill the teacher shortage. Our country has a teacher shortage, which we tend to fill as soon as possible.  </p>
<br><br>
<h4><b><u>Providing clean environment to our youth:</u></b></h4>
<br>
<p> 

   
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we want to provide a safe environment for our pupils, as trash in schools is increasing across the country, with a lack of bins being one of the major causes. We want to create a safe environment for those who will populate our future generations. Allergies and health problems such as cancer are caused by living in a dirty environment. In order to provide a cleaner place for students to dump their trash and keep their surroundings cleaner, we tend to increase the number of rubbish bins, recycling bins, and landfill bins in our schools. Furthermore, we hope to provide a better recycling chain through this as well, as New Zealand is ranked as being one of the countries that does not have a good recycling system in comparison to other countries.

<h3>Economy</h3>

<img src="skytower img.jpg" id="Skytower">

<br>

<h4><b><u>Increasing economy through tourism:</u></b></h4><br>


    <p>We will use the tax money to generate additional revenue.
     The first thing we intend to do is use tax money, and a portion of it, to increase the amount of infrastructure throughout New Zealand. 
     When people come to New Zealand, they go to Auckland, not Wellington or anywhere else. If we improve the infrastructure in each city, a large number of tourists will visit and spend more money in our country. 
     This plan's investment rate will be covered in approximately one year. We can build more infrastructure, such as skyscrapers and activity tracks. </p>

     <br>
<br>
<h4><b><u>Increasing economy through business:</u></b></h4><br>
<p>We can set a policy in the economic system that businesses founded in less than five years pay lower taxes than current rates. In our vision, more investors will try their hand at starting a business, and the <!-- <br><br><img src="agriculture.png" id="agriculture">-->
    unemployment rate will fall in the long run, and the amount of tax collected by the government will rise, as will our economy and standard of living, as more people's income will be taxed.</p>

    <br><br><img src="agriculture.png" id="agriculture">

    
<h4><b><u>Increasing economy through agriculture:</u></b></h4>

     <br>
<p>Farmers who invest in land in order to produce and sell goods outside of New Zealand will receive a small payment from the government. Through this act, we hope to help farmers and increase agriculture in New Zealand. Through this act, New Zealand can become more self-sufficient, preventing money from leaving the country, and we will be able to import outside of New Zealand on a larger scale and for larger amounts, leading a growth in our GDP.</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>

     <br>
     <h4><b><u>Putting a stop to overfishing:</u></b></h4>

     <br>
     <p>
        Apart from other sectors, our party would like to concentrate on one of the most serious issues: overfishing, which is widespread in New Zealand. Everyone knows that New Zealand is a major exporter of seafood, particularly fish; the seafood industry generates $1 billion in revenue for us each year. However, because the seafood industry is overfishing on a larger scale, it is a major concern in New Zealand, as our country's majority of income comes from marine life, which is a factor for tourism and adventure. Scientists predict that overfishing will deplete fish stocks by 2048, with other sea life animals impacted by biodiversity also suffering as a result of the large-scale decline in fish numbers.
        Despite a slight decrease in percentage each year, the impact remains significant. We will impose stringent regulations, such as fining retailers who overfish and establishing no-fishing zones. Anyone caught fishing in that area will have their licence revoked and could face a $10,000 fine. We need to do this if we want to keep making money from this industry, and we also want our seas to perform better in relation to their marine life friends. </p>
     
    
     <br><br>
     <h4><b><u>Recover from deforestation:</u></b></h4>
     <br>
     <p>Secondly, our party would like to focus on a major global issue: deforestation. New Zealanders have lost 12% of our forest cover in the last two decades. We tend to compensate for pollution and global warming by planting more trees. To keep the cycle going, we want to plant more trees in order to restore New Zealand's clean vibes and generate more money by cutting more trees and replanting two trees after we cut one down. We also do this to improve all citizens' life expectancy due to trees' making a healthy atmosphere, which raises our happiness and multiple positive indexes in comparison to other foreign countries.

<h3 id="Ads">Advertisement:</h3>
<br>


<p id="p">During the election, I intend to spend the money on large advertisements near public transportation hubs. In addition, in the most crowded areas, such as CBD, I will promote my party, by placing large banners to attract the attention of people of all ages and backgrounds.<br><br>

    In addition, I intend to use social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for free advertising. This is done to target young and middle-aged people who spend a lot of time on social media.  
      <br>    <br>
    Lastly, I will run advertisements on YouTube, radio, and television to attract older people who do not use social media. </p>

    <br><br>

<br><br>
    <h3 id="Coal">Coalition:</h3>

  <p> 

    We will form a coalition with the Labour Party. We are working in a coalition with Labour because our policies are so similar. Labour is on the left, whereas we are a moderate party remaining in the middle. Labour wants to collaborate with us on the future of our country's economy, which has been severely harmed by Covid during 2020-2022. Furthermore, both parties care about children's education in New Zealand, as well as the environment and our youth. We aim to work together to build an ideal New Zealand, which will be loved by all nations around the world.  </p>
